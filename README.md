# SupremeBot
A Beta Supreme Bot I made in python. 
Making a far better one in Javascript, HTML, and CSS

This is a supreme bot I made when I first learned python.

It is kind of slow but dont get me wrong will still get the job done.

The only problems with it is that the front end design (GUI) is not very appealing 
and your chances of getting a Captcha are higher since you are using a test browser. 
Be cautious and dont expect this bot to work 100% of the time.

To install you must download Chromedriver and have it in your Downloads folder, or where ever you change the location in the code

Running the script requires:  
Selenium and Pyqt5 to be installed

If your looking for the better version it will be ready for purchase soon on my website   hypepy.com
and dm me on instagram @hype_pickups

I will also not update the item codes on the google doc. you can find them yourself by google supreme item codes or getting a vpn and going to the uk supreme website right clicking on an item and inspecting it then scrolling until you see the img url, then you will see alt=(item code)

I have an idea for adding a script of when you press a button it opens up a window with a captcha and when you solve it it copies the cookies and adds them to the test browser to reduce your captcha chances but I dont have the time to add it.

or.. you can just set a really long timer before the drop and start solving captchas maybe that will help.
